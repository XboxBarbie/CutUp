# CutUp
The Cut-up Method is implemented in Python!

Before using this program, create a 'Texts' folder and fill it with .txt files you'd like to 'cut up.' The program will ask the user for the number of words, lines, and the style they want. There are three types of styles:

1. Random: Will repeat every second line
2. Repeat: Will have a higher chance to repeat lines near the end of lines
3. Thematic: Will print lines with a similar sentiment
