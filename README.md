# CutUp
The Cut-up Method is implemented in Python!

Before using this program, create a folder called Texts (yes, exactly as is) and fill it with .txt files you'd like to 'cut up.' The program will ask the user the amount of words, lines, and the kind of style wanted. There are three types of styles:

1. Repeat: Will repeat every second line
2. Crescendo: Will have a higher chance to repeat lines near the end of lines
3. Thematic: Will print lines with a similar sentiment
